      "comments":"Air Crash Investigation is a tragic tale that I wrote taking inspiration from two films: Memento, for its design of working through the stories in both chronological directions; and Non-Stop for its theme of investigating passenger profiles shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe objective of this story is to work the reader through the investigation process in Cordell\u2019s perspective, and later relate the decisions made with the relationship between Cordell, Amanda and the suspects in the investigation. These choices are meant to focus and empower the reader on manipulating the high-stakes of the story, those being the romance with Amanda, the outcome of the investigation and the fate of Cordell.\n\nThe reader is first presented with the opportunity to make a choice in the study of the flight recorder: either to send it in for repair or to keep it for another listening. Sending it in will prevent the reader from using it again while keeping it allows the reader to view garbles in between the profiles that could shed light on the crash. This choice is then associated in retrospect with Cordell\u2019s true intention in the investigation: to disrupt it knowing that depressed Amanda crashed the plane, or to follow through and find the real cause and culprit. The choice here affects the storyline thoroughly, especially towards the latter half, after Cordell\u2019s dream. The dilemma in handling the flight recorder with little context was a constraint set to parallel Cordell\u2019s dilemma in working against his ethics and also to entice readers to replay.\n\nThe second choice was planted in the dreamscape, where the reader is again caught in a dilemma between love and work. Based on the reader\u2019s personality, Cordell would either propose to Amanda or have their relationship strained and land in a breakup. These alternate realities are then reflected in his perception of Amanda upon waking up as well as in the ending. In retrospect, the reader could also analyse the artefacts differently, such as whether the coffee mug was returned to Cordell after the breakup or an indication that Cordell and Amanda cohabited after the proposal; and whether the pager message was sent by Cordell to Amanda, or the other way round. This gives the reader some freedom and agency in interpreting and dictating the fantasy.\n\nAfter investigating the suspects from their individual perspectives and from Cordell\u2019s point of view, the reader is given the choice of picking the culprit after revealing Cordell\u2019s intention. In the case that Amanda did not crash the plane, the only \u201ccorrect\u201d culprit would be Hugo Dewitt, from his relatively reasonable motives to crash the plane and his last words when leaving Martha. Then, the reader is given the opportunity to single out the culprit, which would lead to different press releases for the incident, and subsequently whether Cordell could live with the choice he made in the ending. The decision here relates the reader with Cordell\u2019s sense of justice, and his acuity in investigating the suspects. The reader also receives feedback through the different degrees of closure at the end, based on their investigation work.\n\nThe last choice left to the reader would be to decide on Cordell\u2019s resignation. This associates the reader with Cordell\u2019s sense of guilt and righteousness. Eventually, this choice affects the ending scenario that Cordell would land in, ranging from being guilt-tripped and out of focus when driving to work, to escaping to another country. This choice is auxiliary to the other choices above, in that it is dependent on the other choices in determining the ending.\n\nMurray mentioned dramatic compressions as thematic crucial moments that connect with the main story. In this plot, these moments are abstracted by the artefacts laid out \u201con the desk\u201d in hypertext. These artefacts allow the reader to optionally explore the environment and background of the main character at multiple points of the story, similar to how the playable game \"Their Angelic Understanding\" by Porpentine used the environment and exploration to present story fragments. In this case, the fragments are intentionally left vague to hint but not immediately reveal the relationship between Cordell and Amanda. They contribute to the story arc when the reader reflects and relates to them in retrospect. Notably, the reader also gets to explore the manifest and read the profiles in a different order, giving some level of freedom and control over the development of the story.\n\nAkin to Aisle by Sam Barlow, this story maintains several facts and constraints across different instantiations that the player can leverage on, resulting in different endings. In Aisle, the player encounters some limits in the interaction verbs, and are presented with some common introductory facts, such as the Gnocchi and the brunette woman. In the different replays, the player eventually figures the connection between these entities. In this story, the constants are the artefacts on the desk and the investigation table. They provide common context to the readers, but their meaning varies as the story instance unfolds based on the combinations of choices the reader makes.\n\nAccording to Michael Mateas\u2019 structural definition of agency, it is critical to strike a balance between the material and formal constraints, with actions motivated by dramatic probability and affordances from the spectacle, pattern and thought. In this story, the agency is maintained by balancing material constraints such as the artefacts available and their spectacle into the plot, with the formal constraints of the dramatic probability in decision-making, based on the chronological progression and plot reveal. In the first play-through, the reader experiences agency mainly in exploring the relations and background of the character and the chronological constraints allow them to focus on that and only concern themselves with the entire plot in retrospect. In subsequent replays, the rebalancing of the constraints allows the readers to focus on exploring the possible outcomes and endings, with the general plot and relationships in mind.\n\n(976 words, excluding references below)\n\nReferences:\n1.

As much as he believed in Amanda, he couldn't fathom why the public was set to defame her, to strip her of her dignity as a true pilot. \n\nThose speculations, perhaps they were just trying to blame the incident on someone. Perhaps they were desperately seeking some form of closure to the case. Or perhaps, his colleagues and superiors were just looking forward to enjoy another carefree weekend.\n\nUnlike them, Amanda meant the world to him and the least he could do for her was to identify the true culprit. Cordell knew he had to keep their relationship private to stay in the investigation. To think they were about to get married by the end of the year...\n\nNow, the most instinctive thing to do was to recover the black box, and so he did. If only it could provide him with some clue...\n\n"

Cordell savoured the delicious sandwich delightedly. As much as he wanted to praise Amanda, he couldn't do much with his mouth full. \n\nThe couple sat under a maple tree by the pond. The spot was scenic and perfect for a romantic picnic lunch.\n\nAMANDA: \"Guess what, love? I passed my pilot exam and earned my wings!\"\n\nCORDELL: \"THAT'S AMAZING DEAR! I'M SO PROUD OF YOU!\"\n\nCordell hugged Amanda as tightly as he could and kissed her on her cheeks.\n\nCORDELL: \"Hold on ...\"\n\n\"I will go fetch the wine! This calls for a toast!\"\n\n\"Argh... I'll have to answer this. I'll be back in a jiffy!\"",
